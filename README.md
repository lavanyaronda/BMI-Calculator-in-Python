Title: BMI Calculator in Python ðŸ§®ðŸ’ª
Description:
In this repository, you'll find a simple command-line BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Python. The BMI is a useful measure to evaluate whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. This program prompts users for their weight in kilograms and height in meters, calculates their BMI, and classifies it into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese based on standard ranges. This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice their Python skills and learn more about health tech.

Features:
Prompt users for weight in kilograms and height in meters
Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
Classify BMI into categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI >= 30
Display the BMI result and the corresponding category
